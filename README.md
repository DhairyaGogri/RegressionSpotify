This Jupyter Notebook is a comprehensive analysis of predicting the popularity of Spotify songs using machine learning techniques. The notebook provides step-by-step instructions and code for handling the regression problem, making it valuable for both beginners and experienced data scientists.

The notebook begins with an introduction to Spotify as a popular music streaming application and sets the objective of predicting song popularity based on various attributes present in the dataset. These attributes include danceability, valence, energy, loudness, and more. Predicting song popularity can aid artists, music labels, and industry professionals in identifying potential hits and creating music that resonates with listeners.

To accomplish this goal, the notebook utilizes several Python packages. Pandas is used for reading and manipulating the dataset, while NumPy facilitates mathematical operations on the data. Matplotlib and Seaborn are employed for data visualization, allowing for the creation of informative graphs and correlation matrices in the form of heatmaps. The scikit-learn library is leveraged to implement and evaluate different regression models.

The notebook includes the implementation of the following regression models:
- Linear Regression: A classic model that establishes a linear relationship between the dependent variable (popularity) and independent variables (song attributes).
- Support Vector Machine (SVM): A powerful algorithm that separates data into different classes based on hyperplanes in a high-dimensional space.
- Random Forest: An ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees to produce accurate predictions.
- Decision Tree: A model that creates a flowchart-like structure to make decisions based on conditions.
- Gradient Boosting Regressor: A boosting algorithm that builds an ensemble of weak models to create a strong predictive model.

Evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) are used to assess the performance of the regression models. Additionally, preprocessing techniques like handling null values and removing duplicates are applied to clean the dataset and improve the accuracy of the models.
